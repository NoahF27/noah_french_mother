I am your mother (I am your mother), you listen to me (you listen to me)
Stop all that mansplainin', no one's listening
Tell me, who gave you the permission to speak? (Speak)
I am your mother (I am your mother), you listen to me (shh)

M-m-m-mister big boy, pullin' up in your big toy
Sayin' all that blah-blah-blah, makin' all that big noise
'Cause you're so frustrated, emasculated
'Cause you got your crap called out by this little lady (my baby)
